    <h1>Career</h1>
    <p>Yung Lean began making music with Yung Sherman and Gud in 2012. He would share his music on Soundcloud and Tumblr and performed his first
        show in Gothenburg in May 2013. Later in the year, his song Ginseng Strip 2002 went viral across social media, leading him to abrupt early
        success. In July, he released his debut mixtape, Unknown Death 2002.</p>
    <p>In 2014, he along with the rest of Sad Boys embarked on the White Marble Tour, consisting of 24 shows across Europe, and later the Black Marble
        tour across North America. His performance at New York City's Webster Hall was received favourably in publications such as XXL and The New York Times.</p>
    <p>In September of that year, he released Unknown Memory, his first studio album. It consisted of 13 tracks, and featured contributions from Travis Scott
        alongside production from Whitearmor and fellow Sad Boys members Yung Sherman and Gud (credited as Yung Gud).</p>
    <p>By 2015, Leandoer had moved to Miami Beach, US to record his second studio album Warlord. During this time,
        he became addicted to drugs and suffered a psychosis, leading him to be hospitalised.</p>
    <p>In February 2016, Warlord was released.</p>
    <p>In May 2020, Yung Lean released Starz. It featured production from Whitearmor and vocal contributions from the likes of Ariel Pink and Playboi Carti.

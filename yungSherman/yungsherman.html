    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Tufvesson was born in, and grew up in Stockholm, Sweden. Little is publicly known of his life before the release of his first music. 
        He began releasing music online in 2011. In 2012, Tufvesson met and struck up a friendship with Yung Lean and Gud. Later in the year, 
        the three formed the musical collective Sad Boys. Around the same time, the members of Sad Boys were introduced to Drain Gang, another 
        Stockholm based music collective, via mutual friends and shared music taste. In 2013, when Drain Gang was officially formed under the 
        moniker Gravity Boys, Yung Sherman was credited as a member. Throughout the years, mentions of him as a Drain Gang-member became more 
        sparse—nowadays not being mentioned as a member in any interview or official source.</p>
